# BookStore E-commerce API

## Problem Description 

---
**An API exists to communicate with another program. This Bookstore E-commerce API should allow users to signup, login, see the list of all books in stock and place an order(s). 
When a user signup, s/he should recieve a notification email. The user also recieves a notification email when s/he places an order.
The user should be able to create and add books to their cart and also perform other CRUD(Create-Read-Update-Delete) functionality on their cart, i.e creating, retrieving, updating and also deleting a cart item.**
